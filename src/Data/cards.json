                    "description": "<b>A brief description of CC Libraries</b><br/><br/>Creative Cloud Libraries is a panel that exists within most applications at Adobe that allows designers to have a single source of truth for their assets.<br/><br/>The example I always like to use is this — Imagine that you’re working as a designer at ESPN, and you want to make a graphic promoting the Cleveland Browns vs the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football. In order to make that easily, you’ll need the logos, colors, and fonts for each team along with the logos, colors, and fonts used for Monday Night Football. This can be an annoying process, as each time you’d have to hunt down the correct information from each team, or import all the assets from a shared dropbox.<br/><br/>Libraries makes this process easier, as it allows for you to create a library containing assets you’d need and share them with the people that will need it. Coming back to our example, there could be a shared library that contains every NFL team’s logo, colors, and fonts that would be shared amongst designers at ESPN. There could also be a shared library containing anything that is consistently used to make Monday Night Football graphics as well. So instead of having a designer hunt down these assets themselves, they would just easily find these assets in a library.<br/><br/><b>My Experience with the Team</b><br/><br/>The Libraries team is a very unique team within Adobe, as it is an independent team integrating the libraries panel into other Adobe applications. This means that the libraries panel has to do the job of mimicking the surrounding application that the panel is hosted in, both in style and functionality. This adds an extra layer of complexity to development, as making anything for the panel requires testing changes in at least a few different application to make sure it works as expected. That said, it is an extremely fun and rewarding experience to understand what value I am bringing to the customer with what I am developing, especially with my personal experience using the product.",

I worked on the frontend-focused team, so I mostly focused on getting backend information from .NET and displaying it well using React.js. However, I got a wide variety of issues such as:<ul><li>Find a bug in an image file processor / optimizer, where the image thumbnail does not display.</li><li>Add a sliding animation to a product carousel when the user interacts with the carousel.</li><li>Implement the LogRocket tracking pixel onto the site for UX help & debugging information.</li><li>Help create the design framework for the server-side rendered footer.</li></ul>",

She wants to order this pair of socks online at StoreA’s online website. To do this, she hops on Google Chrome, visits StoreA’s website, and finds a good pair of black socks on the site. However, she gets distracted by something else and ends up going off of the page to do something else. A few days later, Sally is visiting one of her favorite blogs when an advertisement appears on the sidebar from StoreA. In this advert, she sees the same pair of socks as before, along with a few other similar pairs of socks!<br/><br/>What Sally just saw was a dynamic+ advertisement. When Sally visited StoreA’s site, StoreA was able to use a tracking pixel to figure out what products Sally viewed. StoreA took a product that they know Sally is interested in and showed them an advertisement that includes that same product. This specific process is called retargeting, since companies are just showing information that they know already exists.</br></br><b>My Dynamic+ Banner Generator</b></br></br>Dynamic+ Banners are a feature that is provided to a large variety of clients that PMG serves, such as Madewell, Old Navy, Ralph Lauren, and many other high-profile companies. Before this tool was made, a developer at PMG had to go in and manually create every one of the 7 or 8 sizes of dynamic banner, and manually hook up the feed to customize the banner and the feed to display custom products. The even more frustrating thing is that the process could easily be automated, since PMG provided a number of templates when presenting Dynamic+ Advertisements to companies. Therefore, many of the banners looked very similar, with only a few customization tweaks made by the company.<br/><br/>The generator I created was a Node.js command line tool. My generator solved that issue by providing both an easy way to generate the basic templates, along with the flexibility to make tweaks to an individual project based on client-specific feedback. It allowed for all of the different banner sizes to use the same Javascript file, so a change to the feed didn’t have to be copied over 7 or 8 times. It also generated zips in the correct format to easily upload to Google Studio (formerly known as Doubleclick Studio). I also created one of the templates for the Dynamic+ banner, so you know who to blame if you get a Madewell ad in the future :).<br/><br/>Overall, my tool allowed for Dynamic+ Banners to be made much more quickly, allowing developers to focus more on productive tasks. I learned a lot about Node, HTML/CSS, and a lot about how the advertising world works.",

I would work very closely with professors and faculty in the department, so I got good at setting expectations, and giving an accurate scope of how long a specific project would take. The editing of websites themselves was done strictly by changing the HTML through Drupal, so I had no access to the stylesheet or any scripts. Most of the time I didn’t need either of those, since the University has a pretty extensive web framework that made my job much easier. However, I often times found weird workaround solutions to my problems that required adding my own script tag or style tag.<br/><br/>My other job was to create / update the Colloquium graphics for the semester. I designed a template for the colloquium graphics using Adobe Illustrator, and was expected to maintain the TV screens in the chemistry building to display the correct information at all times.<br/><br/>Overall, I learned a lot about HTML, but my most valuable experience I got out of this job was to manage and set the expectations of others, and to work with clients to get to them what they want.<br/><br/>",

Since I was submitting a resumé to a lot of companies, I wanted to make this customization easy on my end, so I wouldn’t have to spend an unnecessary amount of work time getting something to look good. The easiest way to do this, in my eyes, was to change the colors of the website to match the colors of the company I was applying to. That way I have control over the shape and layout of my website, but I can reach that goal.<br/><br/>The content on the website (including the specific themes) is controlled through json files, so I wouldn’t run into the problem I had before where I found it difficult to maintain the website. This time, if I wanted to make a change to the site, it was as easy as saving a change to my json file and pushing it to my repository. In fact, I’ve made a large number of changes to the website since initially publishing it to my domain.<br/><br/>Overall, this was one of the most fun project I have worked on, and I had a really good time figuring out applying my new React knowledge and learning how to use contexts in a meaningful way."

As a fair warning, I will be talking about various game mechanics and assuming you have a basic understanding of what Minecraft is and the items and mechanics that Minecraft has. If you don’t a lot of this may end up being quite confusing.<br/><br/>The origins of my racing plugin started on my creative server. I am participating in a survival server with a bunch of my friends, and I was looking for a new project to start working on. I had heard that you can make race tracks by allowing boats to slide on ice, so I ended up spending a night throwing together a pretty simple layout just to see if it was any fun and it was worth pursuing. Turns out — yes — as evidenced by staying up until 2am that night trying to beat my times using my phone’s stopwatch to time myself. The next day I brought a friend onto my server, and we ended up setting up a small ingame timer and spending that night as well trying to compete for the best times we could. As time went on and my friends and I got more and more into getting the best times, I thought I’d apply my coding skills and make a plugin that can record times and save them so that my friends and I could compete for the best scores independently of each other.<br/><br/>That led me down a long path starting with a simple timing plugin for my placeholder racing track, and continuing with a comprehensive plugin for all forms of Minecraft racing. As of now, my plugin can handle checkpoints, splits, leaderboards, and also handle its own multiplayer races so that my friends and I could fairly race against each other.<br/><br/>Overall, this has been a really fun side project to work on, and I’m looking forward to seeing where this continues to take me!"

We felt that since we were going through the same curriculum, we did not feel like we were getting any new information out of the class again. Our solution was to have a self-starting version of the class that allowed us to learn more about creating our own products and have more freedom over what we end up creating. The proposal ended up working, and I, along with 8 other students, ended up being the guinea pigs for this new idea.<br/><br/><b>Phase 1: Exploration</b><br/><br/>For our first semester, we came up with three potential ideas — and did market research on the different ideas to determine wether they were viable and worth moving forward with. We conducted interviews, sent out questionnaires, and generally asked around to see if people had a real interest in the product. Once that was done, we got together as a full team and, based on our research, selected one project to move forward with, which was Grouve!<br/><br/><b>Phase 2: Building</b><br/><br/>For our second semester, we were tasked to work on building the project as a team. I worked as a UX designer and QA engineer for the team. I helped design a user flow using Adobe XD, and test that flow on potential users of our product. I also set up a testing framework so that other devs could easily mock expected data, and wrote tests for the project others were building."

Henry, our sponsor, had an idea for an app, and paid for us to execute his idea. The basic idea for the app was that it was like a smart scheduling app. The app would take an input of people, possible times, and possible event titles and set up a poll that gets sent to that list of people, then chooses the best event and creates a calendar invite for that best event. It also incorporates some NLP so that the bot can understand anything that is sent in the group chat and adjust accordingly.<br/><br/>"

The basic concept was that, with a grid-based password, we can make a blank space its own set of characters that can make passwords harder to decipher, longer, and stronger. We conducted our own study that showed that users were more likely to remember these grid passwords, rather than a newly created string password. However, we found that the grid password was extremely annoying and frustrating for users to use, and and the time it took to enter their password was around 3x longer than that of a normal password. Overall, it was an interesting experiment that gave us some insight into the challenges of the interfaces behind software security."
